I would do:

SELECT AVG(energy)
FROM songs +

SELECT AVG(valence)
FROM songs +

SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM songs;

/ 3

This calculates the average between the three averages,
ultimately determining a person's audio aura.

However, this may not be representative of the listener
because the meaning behind a song also adds to the listener's
enjoyment of songs. A better way of calculating this aura is to instead
get listeners to rate each other's audio aura to see which aura most
encapsulates the aura of other listeners!
